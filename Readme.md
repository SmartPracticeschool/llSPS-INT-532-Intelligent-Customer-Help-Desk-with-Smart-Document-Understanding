llSPS-INT-532-Intelligent-Customer-Help-Desk-with-Smart-Document-Understanding
The aim of the project was to build a Intelligent Customer Help Desk With Smart Document 
Understanding using different services available on the IBM cloud.

The project was divided into several modules or tasks.

1.Register on the IBM cloud.
   Different services used in this project :- 
   -Watson Discovery 
   -Watson Assistant 
   -Node-Red
   -Cloudant Database(To store Node-Red flow Configuration)

2.Use Watson Assistant which is a conversation AI platform from the catalog section to 
  create a basic customer care dialog skill.

3.Use Watson discovery from the catalog section,with the help of smart document understanding 
  build a watson discovery collection. This will allow us to easily extract specific, clean answers 
  from complicated business documents such as the ecobee_user guide.

4.To integrate watson assitant with discovery service or to allow Watson Assistant to post 
  queries to Watson Discovery,use IBM Cloud Functions web action.

5.Use Node-Red from the catalog to create a simple web UI and integrate all the services 
  into the web-app.
